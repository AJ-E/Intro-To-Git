# Git Workshop
This pre-phase 1 workshop is designed for people who have little or no experience in Git and GitHub. You will be using GitHub for your phase 1 and phase 2 projects, so it's helpful to learn about it now.

In this workshop, we'll not only learn about the basics of Git and GitHub, like - what is a commit? what is a branch? , but also about the advanced features, like - pull requests. We will also do some hands-on practice so you can understand and master the basics. We'll be there to support you guys during this practice round.

As always, you can ask us any questions that you might have during this workshop. We'll also be available in the discord chat after the workshop.

# What to Bring 
Make sure you have downloaded and installed the following applications before the workshop:
* Git ( download link: https://git-scm.com/downloads )
* GitHub Desktop ( download link: https://desktop.github.com/ )
* VS Code ( download link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download ) 

Note: VS Code is not necessary; any code editor would work.

<h3>Please make a GitHub account before the workshop starts. You will use this in the practical part of the workshop.</h3>
